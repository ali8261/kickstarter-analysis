## Overview of Project
An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaign
### Purpose
-1) to find out the outcome for "Theater" based on dates, 
-2) to find out the outcome for "Plays" based on Goal's amount   

## Analysis and Challenges
-
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
-The months that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns were May and June. However, January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
- Goals that are lower than 5000 have higher successful outcome than goals that are more than 5000, the same is true for total projects.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
-The theatre campaign's outcome is most successful in late spring and early summer.
-The number of failed campaigns is fairly consistent regardless of the date. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
-The success rate seems to be higher for goals that are less than 5000. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
-The genre is not included in the data set.
-We do not know if high profile actors are included in the production. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- We could make a graph of the percentage funded in comparison to the productions success rate.
